# Linux Terminal Native Boost

![WIP](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-wip-red.svg)

Start *living* in the Linux terminal. Get started right. Here’s what
we’ll learn:

0.  The UNIX Philosophy
1.  Linux Bash Command Line
2.  Bash Scripting with Ed/Vim
3.  Screen and TMUX Multiplexers
4.  W3M, Lynx, Curl for Web
5.  GPG, Pass, and SSH
6.  Git, GitHub, and DockerHub
7.  Data, Markdown, and Pandoc

This is the way.

The reason for “no derivatives” CC requirement is to preserve the
consistency of opinions throughout the content since attribution is
required. Without it, forks with changed opinions and resource listings

that plagues community-created content. That said, please reach out by
